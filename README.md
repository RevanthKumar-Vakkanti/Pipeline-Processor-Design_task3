## DESCRIPTION: TASK-2

=> Design a *4-stage pipelined processor* with basic instructions like *ADD, SUB & LOAD.*

  * A pipelined processor is a type of processor that divides the execution of instructions into multiple stages.
    Instead of executing one instruction at a time, a pipelined processor overlaps different stages of multiple instructions, improving overall performance.
    It works similarly to an assembly line, where different parts of an instruction are processed simultaneously in different pipeline stages.
